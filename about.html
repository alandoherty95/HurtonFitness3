                        <p>"Iain is a professional well-prepared trainer with natural charisma, a positive outlook and a growth mindset. The product he delivers to me has responded to any challenge and consistently improved in quality over time. Iain's classes are an excellent fit for me as they are varied and fun. Iain is very professional and is always there early with class equipment set up ready to greet participants as they arrive. He also has good session plans made but is comfortable to adapt if an extra person turns up or if somebody joins in late."</p>

He had a very kind and gentle approach to teaching, he acknowledged my fear in the water and personalised techniques that helped me relax in the water and become confident in my abilities. Thanks to Iain I am now confident in the water and absolutely love swimming. My confidence and ability has definitely grown. I highly recommend Iain as a fitness/swim instructor for somebody wanting to reach their individual goals."</p>

                     <p class="lead py-2">I love all kinds of exercise including swimming, lifting weights, running and hiking. Fitness is my passion in life. I found my love of fitness at 16 years old and I haven't looked back since. Through my love of fitness, I hope to inspire as many people as possible to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                     <p class="lead py-2">My favourite way to exercise would be a push/pull training plan. Pull exercises focuses on back and arm while other exercises cover legs and core. That being said, I really enjoy circuit training because it is challenging and makes me want to better my last attempt.</p>
